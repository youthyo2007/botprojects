# Handling Attachments

Bot Framework v4 handling attachments bot sample.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to send outgoing attachments and how to save attachments to disk.

> **NOTE: A specific example for Microsoft Teams, demonstrating how to
upload files to Teams from a bot and how to receive a file sent to a bot as an attachment, can be found [here](../56.teams-file-upload)**

This sample is a Spring Boot app and uses the Azure CLI and azure-webapp Maven plugin to deploy to Azure.

## Prerequisites

- Java 1.8+
- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- An account on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) if you want to deploy to Azure.

## To try this sample
- From the root of this project folder:
  - Build the sample using `mvn package`
  - Run it by using `java -jar .\target\bot-attachments-sample.jar`

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the latest Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
  - Launch Bot Framework Emulator
  - File -> Open Bot
  - Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

With the Bot Framework Emulator connected to your running bot, the sample will show you different types of attachments.

A message exchange between user and bot may contain cards and media attachments, such as images, video, audio, and files.
The types of attachments that may be sent and received varies by channel. Additionally, a bot may also receive file attachments.

## Deploy the bot to Azure
